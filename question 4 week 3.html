    <h2> QUESTION 4</h2>
<div class="BIG"><u>CLASS "BIG" WILL INCREASE THE FONT SIZE OF THE TEXT  TO 20 </u><br>
Your social life involves spending time with your friends, for example at parties or in pubs or bars.
</div>
<p class="BIG"><u>IT HAS FONT SIZE 20 AND ALSO CHANGES  BACKGROUNDCOLOR TO GREEN COLOR</u> <br>
    I believe that the social life of the child is the basis of concentration, or correlation, in all his training or growth. 
    The social life gives the unconscious unity and the background of all his efforts and of all his attainments.
